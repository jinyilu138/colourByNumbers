# this is my colour by numbers project!

**why:** I started working on this because I was interested in image processing, and I also had a phase of playing colour by numbers games on my ipad. lol.
**future plans:** adding some type of graphics processing/effect to this! I'm super interested in graphics and low level driver code to create cool graphics, especially in games!
